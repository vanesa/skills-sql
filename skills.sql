-- 1. Select all columns for all brands in the Brands table.

SELECT name 
FROM Brands;

-- 2. Select all columns for all car models made by Pontiac in the Models table.

SELECT name 
FROM Models 
WHERE brand_name = 'Pontiac';

-- 3. Select the brand name and model 
--    name for all models made in 1964 from the Models table.
SELECT name, brand_name 
FROM Models 
WHERE year = '1964';

-- 4. Select the model name, brand name, and headquarters for the Ford Mustang 
--    from the Models and Brands tables.

SELECT m.name, m.brand_name, b.headquarters
FROM Models AS m
JOIN Brands AS b
ON m.brand_name=b.name
WHERE m.brand_name="Ford"
AND m.name="Mustang";

-- 5. Select all rows for the three oldest brands 
--    from the Brands table (Hint: you can use LIMIT and ORDER BY).
SELECT * 
FROM Brands 
ORDER BY founded 
LIMIT 3;

-- 6. Count the Ford models in the database (output should be a **number**).

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Models 
WHERE brand_name = 'Ford';

-- 7. Select the **name** of any and all car brands that are not discontinued.

SELECT name 
FROM Brands 
WHERE discontinued is NULL;

-- 8. Select rows 15-25 of the DB in alphabetical order by model name.

SELECT * FROM Models 
ORDER BY name 
LIMIT 11 
OFFSET 14; -- This orders the tables before outputting of rows 15 -25

SELECT * 
FROM Models 
LIMIT 11 
OFFSET 14; -- This outputs rows 15 -25 but I can't order the output alphabetically.


-- 9. Select the **brand, name, and year the model's brand was 
--    founded** for all of the models from 1960. Include row(s)
--    for model(s) even if its brand is not in the Brands table.
--    (The year the brand was founded should be ``null`` if 
--    the brand is not in the Brands table.)

SELECT m.brand_name, m.name, b.founded 
FROM Models AS m 
LEFT JOIN Brands AS b 
ON m.brand_name = b.name 
WHERE m.year = 1960
UNION all
SELECT m.brand_name, m.name, b.founded 
FROM Models AS m 
LEFT JOIN Brands AS b 
ON m.brand_name = b.name
WHERE b.name IS NULL;

-- Part 2: Change the following queries according to the specifications. 
-- Include the answers to the follow up questions in a comment below your
-- query.

-- 1. Modify this query so it shows all brands that are not discontinued 
-- regardless of whether they have any models in the Models table.
-- before:
    -- SELECT b.name,
    --        b.founded,
    --        m.name
    -- FROM Models AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN brands AS b
    --     ON b.name = m.brand_name
    -- WHERE b.discontinued IS NULL;

-- after:
    SELECT b.name, b.founded, m.name
    FROM Brands AS b
        LEFT JOIN Models AS m
          ON b.name = m.brand_name
    WHERE b.discontinued IS NULL
    GROUP BY b.name;


-- 2. Modify this left join so it only selects models that have brands in the Brands table.
-- before: 
    -- SELECT m.name,
    --        m.brand_name,
    --        b.founded
    -- FROM Models AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN Brands AS b
    --     ON b.name = m.brand_name;

-- after:

    SELECT m.name,
           m.brand_name,
           b.founded,
           b.name
    FROM Models AS m
      LEFT JOIN Brands AS b
        ON b.name = m.brand_name
    WHERE m.brand_name = b.name;

    -- or

    SELECT m.name,
           m.brand_name,
           b.founded,
           b.name
    FROM Models AS m
      INNER JOIN Brands AS b
        ON b.name = m.brand_name;


-- followup question: In your own words, describe the difference between 
-- left joins and inner joins.

-- INNER JOINS return all of the records in one table that have a matching record in the other table.
-- LEFT JOINS will return all of the records in the left table even if any of those 
-- records don't have a match in the right table. It will also return any matching records from the right table.

-- 3. Modify the query so that it only selects brands that donâ€™t have any models in the Models table.
-- (Hint: it should only show Tesla.)
-- before: 
    -- SELECT name,
    --        founded
    -- FROM Brands
    --   LEFT JOIN Models
    --     ON brands.name = Models.brand_name
    -- WHERE Models.year > 1940;

-- after:
    SELECT Brands.name,
           founded
    FROM Brands
      LEFT JOIN Models
        ON brands.name = Models.brand_name
        WHERE Models.brand_name IS NULL;


-- 4. Modify the query to add another column to the results to show 
-- the number of years from the year of the model *until* the brand becomes discontinued
-- Display this column with the name years_until_brand_discontinued.
-- before: 
    -- SELECT b.name,
    --        m.name,
    --        m.year,
    --        b.discontinued
    -- FROM Models AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN brands AS b
    --     ON m.brand_name = b.name
    -- WHERE b.discontinued NOT NULL;

-- after:

    SELECT b.name,
           m.name,
           m.year,
           b.discontinued,
           (b.discontinued - m.year) AS years_until_brand_discontinued
    FROM Models AS m
      LEFT JOIN brands AS b
        ON m.brand_name = b.name
    WHERE b.discontinued NOT NULL;

-- Part 3: Futher Study

-- 1. Select the **name** of any brand with more than 5 models in the database.

SELECT b.name From Brands AS b
INNER JOIN Models AS m
ON m.brand_name = b.name
GROUP BY b.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- 2. Add the following rows to the Models table.

-- year    name       brand_name
-- ----    ----       ----------
-- 2015    Chevrolet  Malibu
-- 2015    Subaru     Outback

BEGIN;

INSERT INTO Models (year, brand_name, name) VALUES (2015, 'Chevrolet', 'Malibu');

INSERT INTO Models (year, brand_name, name) VALUES (2015, 'Subaru', 'Outback');

COMMIT;

-- 3. Write a SQL statement to crate a table called ``Awards`` 
--    with columns ``name``, ``year``, and ``winner``. Choose 
--    an appropriate datatype and nullability for each column.

CREATE TABLE Awards(
    name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    year INTEGER(4),
    winner_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT);

-- 4. Write a SQL statement that adds the following rows to the Awards table:

--   name                 year      winner_model_id
--   ----                 ----      ---------------
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      # get the ``id`` of the 2015 Chevrolet Malibu
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      # get the ``id`` of the 2015 Subaru Outback

BEGIN;

INSERT INTO Awards (year, name, winner_id) 
VALUES (2015, 'IIHS Safety Award', 
    (SELECT id 
FROM Models WHERE Models.name is 'Malibu')); 

INSERT INTO Awards (year, name, winner_id) 
VALUES (2015, 'IIHS Safety Award', 
    (SELECT id 
FROM Models WHERE Models.name is 'Outback')); 

COMMIT;



-- 5. Using a subquery, select only the *name* of any model whose 
-- year is the same year that *any* brand was founded.

SELECT m.name, 
FROM Models as m
LEFT JOIN Brands as b
WHERE m.year=b.founded;
